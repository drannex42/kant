# Kant (2022)

> "_There is ... only a single categorical imperative and it is this: Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law" Immanuel Kant, Metaphysics of Morals (1797), Ch. 11_

## An even more monochrome color scheme

Kant (2022) is a monochrome color scheme for JetBrains editors like Intellij IDEA Ultimate and PyCharm.

It is based on the luxurious  monochrome color scheme Kant theme from 2020 by [abrookins](https://github.com/abrookins/kant) (which was based on Verdandi and Verdandi Alter for Visual Studio Code). 

This theme comes in Kant Light (Original), Kant Dark (Original), and Kant Light (2022). The difference between Light and Light 2022 is that the latter is even more monochrome with very, _very_, few colors and now comes with better Elixir support.
